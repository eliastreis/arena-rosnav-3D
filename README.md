# arena-rosnav-3D

This repository combines the 3D ROS simulator Gazebo with Pedsim to provide realistic dynamic 3D scenarios and tasks to evaluate and and benchmark ROS navigation approaches. It is fully compatible with the planning algorithms trained and developed with arena-rosnav (2D). This presents an essential step in deploying the navigation approaches from arena-rosnav towards real robots.

The repo currently contains: 
- Task generator with modes: `random`, `scenario`, `manual`, `staged` 
- Multiple detailed scenario-worlds
- Robot models: `turtlebot3_burger`, `ridgeback`, `jackal`, `agv-ota`
- Creation of random 3D-words with static and dynamic obstacles
- Realistic behavior patterns and semantic states of dynamic obstacles (by including pedsim's extended social force model)
- Implementation of intermediate planner classes to combine local DRL planner with global map-based planning of ROS Navigation stack: `teb`, `dwa`, `mpc`, `cadrl`, `rlca`, `arena`
- Integration with [arena-tools](https://github.com/ignc-research/arena-tools) map generator and [LIRS-World_Construction_Tool](https://gitlab.com/LIRS_Projects/LIRS-WCT). Providing seamless conversion from randomly generated ROS maps to actual Gazebo worlds.
- "Random world" task mode, where with each Task reset, a new Gazebo world is loaded

## 1. Installation

Please refer to [Installation.md](docs/Installation.md) for detailed explanations about the installation process.

> ***NOTE***: This repo is using **ros-noetic** and **python 3.8**

### 2. Usage
<!-- The gui should currently not be used since it is not updated to include multi-robot support -->

<!-- For a finer user experience we provide a Python GUI, please have a look at [GUI.md](docs/GUI.md) for more information.

<!-- Otherwise please  -->
Refer to [Usage.md](docs/Usage.md) for command-line use, as well as detailed explanations about agent, policy and training setups.

**Sample usage**

After successful installation, run the following command with your python-env activated (`workon rosnav`).

```bash
roslaunch arena_bringup start_arena_gazebo.launch local_planner:=teb task_mode:=random world:=small_warehouse actors:=6 
```
## 3. Examples
Here you can see some examples using our different world generating modes

| *Random task mode* | *Arena Generated* |
#### Scenario mode

- Use the supplied scenario or create your own using [arena-tools](https://github.com/ignc-research/arena-tools).
- In scenario mode, all objects will be spawned at their specified position and everything will reset back to this position once the robot reaches its goal.

## Training

To quick start drl training run the following lines. For more detailed information see [this](docs/DRL-Training.md) documentation.
```bash
roslaunch arena_bringup start_arena_gazebo.launch  train_mode:=true use_viz:=true  task_mode:=random

# in a new terminal
roscd arena_local_planner_drl
python scripts/training/train_agent.py --agent MLP_ARENA2D
```
